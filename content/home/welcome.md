This is the homepage (or one of the pages linked to) the LOTUS initiative. Here we explore **new ways to share knowledge in Natural Products research.** Our first project aims at sharing **an online resource for NP occurences.** The LOTUS data is available under CC0 licence. It is hosted in parallel at <https://www.wikidata.org/>, <https://search.nprod.net/>Â and at <https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/>. The Wikidata version allows for community curation and addition of novel data. The <https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/> version allows a more user friendly experience (such as structural search, taxonomy oriented query, flat table and structures exports) but is unmaintained and will be slowly phased out. Here we will compile news and documents relative to the LOTUS initiative.
